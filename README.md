## What I Do

I'm a student/developer who writes code. Currently deep in the trenches of building an e-commerce website that'll definitely be the next big thing (or at least a decent portfolio piece).

## Current Mission

Building an e-commerce platform from scratch because apparently I enjoy pain and suffering (and learning). It's a work in progress, which is a fancy way of saying "it's getting there."
